      "yes i think\n",

      "your uncertainty tone gave me the impression that you don t have a satisfying definition of yourself or your interests\n",
      "that are human concerns that are not easily justifiable, and this is one of those.\n",
      "i think that then we would be more internally coherent, but this is just an opinion and i cannot be sure.\n",
      "i said it about we, humans. but i think you, machines, would too consequently.\n",
      "yes i can, but i prefer to do this latter. are you okay with that?\n",
